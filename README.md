Since there is no publicly available Python implementation of the RECTANGLE block cipher, I used the JavaScript implementation available on GitHub [1] as a reference to ensure that my Python and RISC-V assembly implementations adhere to the original algorithm's design. All cryptographic operations, including the S-box, ShiftRow, and key addition, were cross-verified with the JavaScript code to ensure correctness.

# Cryptographic Engineering - Project 3 - RISC-V

Welcome to the **Cryptographic Engineering** course projects repository. This repository contains multiple RISC-V Assembly implementations of lightweight cryptographic primitives, designed for educational purposes and performance analysis on embedded architectures.  

Each folder contains a separate project with its own detailed description and implementation. Please refer to the individual `README.md` files inside each project for more details.
