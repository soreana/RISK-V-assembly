# RECTANGLE Cipher – RISC-V Assembly Implementation

This repository contains a **RISC-V Assembly implementation** of a **single round of the RECTANGLE block cipher**, based on a **bitsliced representation**. The implementation follows the official specification and applies:

- **AddRoundKey** (XOR with round key)
- **SubColumn (Bitsliced S-Box transformation, no lookup tables)**
- **ShiftRow (16-bit circular left rotations, correctly implemented in RISC-V)**
- **Final result packing into two 32-bit words for verification**

The implementation is designed to run on a RISC-V environment using SEGGER Embedded Studio (SES).

## 📜 Algorithm Overview

RECTANGLE is a lightweight block cipher that operates on **64-bit blocks**, arranged as a **4×16-bit matrix**. Each round applies three main transformations:

1. **AddRoundKey** – XOR the current cipher state with the round key.
2. **SubColumn (Bitsliced S-Box)** – A non-linear layer applied column-wise using logical operations.
3. **ShiftRow** – A permutation step, rotating rows by different amounts.

For this assignment, we implemented **one round** of the cipher using **pure RISC-V assembly**, without lookup tables.

## Assembly Code Breakdown

### Data Section – Inputs and Outputs

```assembly
.section .data
.global result_L1
.global result_L2

result_L1:  .word 0
result_L2:  .word 0

block_L1:   .word 0x44556677    # Lower 32 bits (0x0011223344556677)
block_L2:   .word 0x00112233    # Upper 32 bits

key_L1:     .word 0xccddeeff    # Lower 32 bits of key (0x8899aabbccddeeff)
key_L2:     .word 0x8899aabb    # Upper 32 bits of key
```

---

### AddRoundKey – XOR with Round Key

```assembly
# XOR block with key
xor s1, t1, t4
xor s2, t2, t5
```

---

### Extract 16-bit Rows from 64-bit State

```assembly
li t0, 0xFFFF     # Mask
and a0, s1, t0    # Row0
srli a1, s1, 16   # Row1
and a1, a1, t0
and a2, s2, t0    # Row2
srli a3, s2, 16   # Row3
and a3, a3, t0
```

---

### SubColumn – Bitsliced S-Box

```assembly
# Example for one step
not t1, a1
and t1, t1, t0    # T1 = ~A1 (masked)
# Followed by logical operations for T2, T3, ..., B0-B3
```

---

### ShiftRow – Circular Rotations

```assembly
# C1 = B1 <<< 1
slli t1, s4, 1
srli t2, s4, 15
or   s4, t1, t2
andi s4, s4, 0xFFFF

# C2 = B2 <<< 12
slli t1, s5, 12
srli t2, s5, 4
or   s5, t1, t2
andi s5, s5, 0xFFFF

# C3 = B3 <<< 13
slli t1, s6, 13
srli t2, s6, 3
or   s6, t1, t2
andi s6, s6, 0xFFFF
```

---

### Packing the Final State

```assembly
# Pack Row1 and Row0 into result_L1
slli a0, s4, 16
or a0, a0, s3

# Pack Row3 and Row2 into result_L2
slli a1, s6, 16
or a1, a1, s5

# Store packed result
la t0, result_L1
sw a0, 0(t0)
sw a1, 4(t0)
```

## Output Verification

```
L1 after 1 round: 0xffff0000
L2 after 1 round: 0x00007777
```

## Reference

This repository contains a **C implementation of the RECTANGLE lightweight block cipher**, based on the public domain reference written by **Hu Qin (Southeast University)**.

### Reference Implementation

The original code was adapted from:

> Hu Qin, *"RECTANGLE C implementation"*  
> Public domain, freely available at: [https://github.com/SalaQ/RECTANGLE](https://github.com/SalaQ/RECTANGLE)  


### Features of This Implementation

- Full **25-round encryption** as specified in the RECTANGLE cipher.
- **Simple and portable C code**, no external dependencies, runs on any platform (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- **Easily configurable** to run a single round (for learning and debugging purposes).
- **Traceable intermediate states** — ability to print internal `block` states after key steps like AddRoundKey, S-box, and ShiftRow.

### Usage

#### Compile:
```bash
gcc rectangle.c -o rectangle
```

#### Run:
```bash
./rectangle
```

#### Example Output:
```
--- Round 0 ---
After AddRoundKey: xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx 
After S-box:       xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx 
After ShiftRow:    xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx 
...
Cipher Text:       xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx
```

### Customization

To run only a **single round**, adjust the number of rounds in `rectangle.c`:

```c
} while (round < 1); // Runs only 1 round
```
